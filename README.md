 This script is very useful when you have a team of developers on a
 project pushing to multiple remote sources

 Usage:

   $ switchgituser.sh 
   1) matt.simpson		 3) kenny.ortmann	  5) arumugam.deivanayaga
   2) amos.king		 4) lori.cross		  6) craig.buchek
   #? 1

 When a user is selected, the .git/config file gets changed to reflect 
 the selected user.
